EBS : elastic block store - storage ...attach with EC2.
create file , run database 
features :
replicated automatically within its availablity zone to protect from component failure 
- high availablity (99.999%) and durability, consistent and low latency performance  reliable and secure. scale up/down based on usage.
- elastic volumes : dynamically increase capacity, tune performance, change live volumes with no downtime 

snapshot - backup - restore - innovate (bring up new EC2)

IOPS : input/output operations per second
2 types : 
- SSD (Solid State Drive) : for transactional - DBs and boot volumnes - performance depends on IOPS
  -  io1 : highest performance, for latency sensitive transactional wrkloads
  -  gp2 : balance price and performance

- HDD (Hard Disk Drives) : for throughput intensive workloads  MR & log processing
  - st1 : for frequently accessed data & throughput intensive
  - sc1 : for less cost , not frequently accessed data
